## BITCOIN WALLET

This project is a **Bitcoin wallet manager** that allows users to **create and manage their wallets** on the Bitcoin testnet network, as well as **send and receive bitcoins** through the Bitcoin blockchain. The system provides real-time balance tracking, secure transaction handling, and integrates with AWS services for enhanced security and scalability.

## Getting Started

- Access the system at: **[JVWallet](https://front.jvwallet.site)**
- After creating your wallets, you can get free Bitcoins for transactions from this faucet: **[Bitcoin Testnet Faucet](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/)**
- You can also check your created wallet and transactions on the **[Blockchain Testnet Explorer](https://blockstream.info/testnet/)**
